            During my internship at PT. Nocola Iot Solution as a Web Developer, I contributed to the
            development of the cems.id website and various projects using CodeIgniter, MySQL, and
            Bootstrap. Over the three-month period, I focused on creating a responsive user
            interface, integrating essential plugins, and customizing themes to align with the
            company's brand identity. I played a crucial role in developing a maintenance system
            application that encompassed preventive maintenance scheduling, work order management,
            master data administration, and detailed reporting functionalities, significantly
            enhancing operational efficiency and proactive equipment management.
